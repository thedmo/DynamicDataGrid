# DataGridDynamicTest

The meaning of this project is to create a wrapper for a class, that takes all the properties of a model and combines them with properties of other classes. 
The goal of this was to have alist of objects that consist of properties from several classes so these objects can be added to a list and set as itemssource for a DataGrid.
All this enables the Grid to actually change the data of the added properties from the added models
